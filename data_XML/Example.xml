        <EconomicImpact>

Ukraine, Argentina, and Jamaica are frequently considered the countries to have been most severely affected by the recession. Ireland, Russia, Mexico, Hungary, the Baltic States, United States and United Kingdom were also deeply affected and most have not completely return to their prior states of economic stability.</li>
