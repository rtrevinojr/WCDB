Beginning around 2010, many countries started began to improve their situations, but most countries have not returned to there previous levels of prosperity. In some countries this is unrealistic because of their artificially high levels of economic prosperity. Ukraine, Argentina, and Jamaica are frequently considered the countries to have been most severely affected by the recession. Ireland, Russia, Mexico, Hungary, the Baltic States, United States and United Kingdom were also deeply affected and most have not completely return to their prior states of economic stability.
