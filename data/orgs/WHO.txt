    The IMF was formally founded in 1945 with 29 countries. Today there are over 188 countries that are involved in the organization. One of the primary reasons for creation of the IMF was in response to the Great Depression during the 1930's. 

[When was it founded?]

The Polaris Project was founded in 2002, by Derek Ellerman and Katherine Chon, who were seniors at Brown University, when they were inspired to create a nonprofit organization that focuses on ending human trafficking and modern-day slavery. [Footnote/reference to wiki citation.]
