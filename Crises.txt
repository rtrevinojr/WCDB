TODO: Please categorize the following

* Arab Spring
* North Korea
* I couldn't think of many but what might help is to go to reddit/r/worldnews, sort by top, and we might find several crises that haven't been taken`  

Probably not world crises:

* Global warming?
  * Calary floods ( http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2013/06/26/f-climate-change-flooding-weather-preparation.html?cmp=rss )
* Boston marathon attacks
* Oslo shootings
